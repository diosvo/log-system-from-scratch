### About this part

The Apache Druid database powers analytical applications for organizations large and small [around the world](https://druid.apache.org/druid-powered). [Under the hood](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/), a highly-optimized data format and shared-nothing, microservices architecture helps deliver on performance, resilience, and availability. On the surface, a fully-fledged SQL dialect enables you to create flexible, interactive analytics UI components for your applications using real-time and batch ingested data.

### Outcome

- Create a single node and clustered Druid database in a virtual lab
- Hear about Druid's processes and how they come together in a shared-nothing, microservices architecture
- Ingest a simple dataset and get a feel for how this works
- See the different SQL interfaces for querying Druid

### What do we need?

Familiarity with Linux is a bonus, but by no means a prerequisite.
