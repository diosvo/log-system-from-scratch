### METRICS MONITORS

Druid emits a basic set of metrics by default: you can add more by configuring Druid with monitors.

Some monitors apply to all Druid processes and some apply only to specific processes.

In this module you will learn:

- What metrics Druid emits by default
- How to configure Druid with monitors to augment the metrics that Druid emits
