### About this part

Druid's distributed design and optimized data storage format make it awesome for large-scale, massively parallel processing and storage. When systems based on this design have issues metrics can help you understand where the problems are.

### Outcome

- Enable metrics gathering
- Extend the basic metrics that Druid emits
- Create a Prometheus and Grafana metrics pipeline for viewing metrics
- Use Kafka and Clarity for optimal metrics interactive viewing

### What do we need?

Familiarity with Linux is a bonus, but by no means a prerequisite.
