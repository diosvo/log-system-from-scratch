As you move on to operate Druid clusters in production, Druid metrics help you **maintain and improve Druid's performance**.

In this learning module you will:

- Enable Druid to emit metrics to log files
- Extract metrics messages from log files using command line tools
- Format metrics using command line tools

The first step in making use of metrics is to become familiar with how to enable metrics and understand the different types of metrics.
